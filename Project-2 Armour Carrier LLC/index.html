                <p>Armour Carrier is immensely grateful for all the sacrifices and demanding work from our active
                    military
                    and veterans.</p><br>
                <p>We show our support by donating a percentage of our proceeds to several different organizations that
                    focus on veterans causes. Americans Mighty Warriors offers a helping hand to soldiers who have been
                    injured in the line of duty by fundraising, spreading awareness, and empowering the recipients.</p>
                <br>
                <p>This organization funds medical treatments for veterans suffering from PTSD and TBI. We would also
                    like
                    to mention the generous work done by Fontaine Trailer and their collaboration with <span>America’s
                        Mighty
                        Warriors.</span></p><br>
                <p>Fontaine Trailer donates $1,000 of each sale of their Patriot Edition Trailers to <span>America’s

                <p>The Fontaine Trailer that Armour Carrier purchased honors the life of Navy SEAL Marc Alan Lee. He was
                    the first SEAL to lose his life in Operation Iraqi Freedom when he was killed in a fierce firefight
                    while on patrol against insurgents in Ramadi. He was posthumously awarded the Silver Star, Bronze
                    Star with Valor, and the Purple Heart. May God bless his family and we salute him for his service.
